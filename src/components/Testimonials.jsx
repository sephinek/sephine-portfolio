                I highly appreciate your ability to facilitate smooth
                communication within the team due to your understanding of both
                development and design. Your experience in development allows
                you to anticipate and consider various unseen cases in UI
                structure, core service features, and user flows. I believe this
                broader perspective and insight were valuable in the UX design
                of Lucid. I am confident that your strong structural
                understanding will be a unique competitive advantage as you
                continue your career as a product designer.
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe your greatest strength lies in the excellent
                communication and management skills you demonstrated during the
                practical project. You set up the team's initial structure with
                a clear strategy, gathered individuals with storng strenghs, and
                created an environment conducive to collaboration. Thanks to
                your efforts, the teamwork in Group 4 (Saffron) was particularly
                strong. I was impressed by how you fostered a positive and
                bright team atmostphere while also leading the team toward
                greater work efficiency. Your ability to listen to and
                coordinate diverse opinions was key to the successful
                progression of the project. I expect your calm communication
                skills to serve as a competitive advantage in any environment.

                Sephine stands out for her ability to lead and organize the team
                effectively. While other team members may take her leadership
                for granted due to her experience with React, I believe her
                ability to lead teams fro her exceptional skills.
              </p>

                As I mentioned in our previous meeting, leadership skills are
                essential for creating a successful team atmosphere, even if not
                in an official leadership role. Sephine already possesses the
                necessary leadership qualities, and I am confident that if she
                continues to develop them, she will be a standout in any
                environment.

                Hello, Sephine! I was truly impressed by the leadership and
                drive you showed throughout the project. Your ability to
                coordinate team members' opinions while staying focused on the
                goal really stood out. I remember that when you first started
                the camp, you aimed for overseas employment, and based on your
                dedication and perserverance, I am confident that you will
                achieve great results in the place you desire. You have a braod
                perspective that covers both UX and UI, and your leadership
                abilities will allow you to shine in various future projects. I
                wholeheartedly support your efforts and passion, and I look
                forward to seeing them bear great fruit.
